Hi,

I am truly sorry for not having been able to implement problem 4 in time. I have been working on the problem set since the end of last week, but evidently grossly underestimated the magnitude and difficulty of this week's problem set. I hope I may confer your understanding as it was my best effort over the course of week with several all-nighters dedicated to this, and, in conjunction, balancing with my upcoming MCB thesis deadline in a couple weeks. I fully understand and will take ownership of any deductions on this assignment, and hope I may have your understanding of the circumstance. 

If there is anything I may do to compensate for the lacking parts of my submission, please let me know.

With sincerest thanks,

Vivian
